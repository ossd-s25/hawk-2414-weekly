# My Thoughts on Open Source  

When I hear the term "open source," I think of freely available tools, knowledge-sharing, and a community-driven approach to development. While I haven’t actively contributed to open source projects, I appreciate the impact they have on technology and education—especially through YouTube tutorials, which in some ways, function as an open-source knowledge hub.  

# Open vs. Closed Source: The Pros and Cons  

One major advantage of open source is accessibility. Anyone can use, modify, and improve the software, leading to rapid innovation and community-driven support. This stands in contrast to  closed-source  software, which is often more polished but locked behind paywalls and strict licenses. However, open source isn't without challenges—security risks, lack of funding, and sustainability issues can make it difficult for projects to thrive long-term.  

# Why I Took This Class  

I registered for this open source software development class because the concept intrigued me. Even though I haven't directly worked on open source projects, I wanted to learn more about how they function, how communities collaborate, and what makes them successful.  

# Open Source Projects That Have Influenced Me  

While I don’t use open source software in the traditional sense, there are several community-driven platforms and resources that have shaped my learning and creativity:  

1.  YouTube Tutorials  – A massive, informal "open-source" learning platform where developers share coding knowledge for free.  
2.  Stack Overflow  – A go-to resource for debugging and learning, powered by an open knowledge-sharing model.  
3.  Unity Asset Store (Free Assets)  – While not fully open source, many developers share free assets, scripts, and tools that help improve game development.  
4.  Wikipedia  – A freely accessible knowledge base that relies on community contributions, much like open source software.
