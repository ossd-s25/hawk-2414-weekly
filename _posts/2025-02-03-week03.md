As I wasn't part of the group working on the browser extension itself, my role was more focused on testing the extensions developed by my classmates. I’ve had the chance to interact with multiple extensions and provide feedback on their functionality, usability, and performance.

### Group 3: Website Time Tracker
In today's digital age, we spend countless hours browsing websites—whether it's social media, news, shopping, or work-related research. But have you ever wondered just how much time you're actually spending on each site?

#### <u>Who Can Benefit from the Website Time Tracker?</u>

🚀 Students & Professionals – Monitor time spent on research, work, or studying.
🛍️ Online Shoppers – See how long you really spend scrolling through e-commerce sites.
📱 Social Media Users – Reduce distractions by being aware of how much time you spend on apps like Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram.

#### <u>What I Like Most & Where It Can Grow</u>
One of the things I love most about the Website Time Tracker extension is its simplicity and usefulness. That said, like any great open-source project, it’s a work in progress—which is what makes it so exciting. Since this class focuses on open-source projects and contributions, there’s an open invitation for classmates to get involved. Already, two open issues have been raised by collaborators within the class, highlighting areas where the extension could be improved. This kind of real-time feedback and contribution is what makes open-source development so rewarding—it’s not just about building something for yourself but creating something that others can improve, refine, and expand upon.
