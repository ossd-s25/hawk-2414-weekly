## My Journey Creating the Tab Organizer Chrome Extension
I have created a web extension as a solo project. It can be viewed [HERE](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Tab-Organizer).

### 🚀 About This Project
I set out to build Tab Organizer a Chrome extension designed to help users group, save, and restore tabs efficiently. The goal was to create a lightweight tool that makes browser tab management effortless, whether for work, research, or everyday browsing.

### 🏗️ The Process
The project started with a simple idea: organize tabs by domain to reduce clutter. As I built it, I incorporated features such as:
- Grouping tabs based on their website domain.
- Saving sessions to allow users to quickly restore important tabs.
- Restoring previously saved tab sessions with a single click.
- A clean and intuitive popup UI for easy navigation.

### 💡 Accomplishments
- Successfully migrated from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 ensuring future compatibility.
- Implemented a service worker and used Chrome’s `alarms` API to keep it alive.
- Created a smooth user experience with an intuitive popup design.
- Learned to troubleshoot icon visibility issues and resolved Chrome extension quirks.
- Set up a GitHub repository for easy distribution and future contributions.

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Challenges
Of course, this wasn’t without its challenges
- Service Worker Inactivity: Chrome’s Manifest V3 service workers don’t persist like in Manifest V2, so I had to implement an alarm-based keep-alive method.
- Icon Not Showing Up: At first, my extension’s icon wouldn’t display, but I fixed it by ensuring correct file paths and image sizes.
- Debugging Extensions: Unlike regular web apps, debugging Chrome extensions requires using chrome://extensions/ and the Inspect tool, which was a learning curve.
- Handling Permissions Correctly: Some permissions didn’t behave as expected, so I had to carefully tweak the `manifest.json` file.

### ✨ What’s Next?
Now that Tab Organizer is up and running, I’m considering adding:
- Keyboard shortcuts for faster tab grouping and session saving.
- Better UI customization so users can personalize how their groups are displayed.
- Syncing across devices so sessions are available on multiple Chrome browsers.

### 📝 Final Thoughts
This project was a fun challenge that taught me a lot about building Chrome extensions, working with Manifest V3, and troubleshooting browser-specific quirks. Despite the hurdles and because I did this project solo, seeing the extension fully functional and available for others to use made the entire process worth it!

As I wasn't part of the group working on the browser extension itself, my role was more focused on testing the extensions developed by my classmates. I’ve had the chance to interact with multiple extensions and provide feedback on their functionality, usability, and performance.

### Group 3: Website Time Tracker
In today's digital age, we spend countless hours browsing websites—whether it's social media, news, shopping, or work-related research. But have you ever wondered just how much time you're actually spending on each site?

#### <u>Who Can Benefit from the Website Time Tracker?</u>

🚀 Students & Professionals – Monitor time spent on research, work, or studying.
🛍️ Online Shoppers – See how long you really spend scrolling through e-commerce sites.
📱 Social Media Users – Reduce distractions by being aware of how much time you spend on apps like Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram.

#### <u>What I Like Most & Where It Can Grow</u>
One of the things I love most about the Website Time Tracker extension is its simplicity and usefulness. That said, like any great open-source project, it’s a work in progress—which is what makes it so exciting. Since this class focuses on open-source projects and contributions, there’s an open invitation for classmates to get involved. Already, two open issues have been raised by collaborators within the class, highlighting areas where the extension could be improved. This kind of real-time feedback and contribution is what makes open-source development so rewarding—it’s not just about building something for yourself but creating something that others can improve, refine, and expand upon.
