# Project Update

## Team Formation and Scheduling
Our team has successfully formed, and we are currently working on finalizing our schedules to determine the best times for collaboration. Scheduling has been a key focus, ensuring that all team members can contribute effectively.

## Project Selection
After evaluating several options, we decided to work with Oppia. Our decision was based on the following factors:
- Alignment with Individual Talents: Each team member found aspects of Oppia that suited their skills, making it a great fit for our collective expertise.
- Sustained Interest: We wanted a project that would keep us engaged throughout the course, and Oppia stood out as an exciting and meaningful initiative.

## Next Steps
- Finalizing our availability for regular meetings.
- Diving deeper into Oppiaâ€™s codebase and contribution guidelines.
- Assigning initial tasks to begin our contributions effectively.
