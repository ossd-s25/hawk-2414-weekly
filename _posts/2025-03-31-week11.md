# Group Project Progress & Reflections

## Project Update: Building a Lesson on Oppia.org

This week, our team made solid progress on our group project for the class. We decided to create an interactive lesson for [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), an open-source platform designed to make education more accessible and engaging. One of the things we really like about Oppia is that it allows us to build out the lesson directly on their site—no coding required.

So far, we’ve brainstormed our learning objectives, outlined the structure of the lesson, and started creating the first few interactions. The platform's builder is surprisingly intuitive once you get used to the flow, and it's been great seeing our lesson take shape in real time. It’s also sparked some interesting team conversations about pedagogy, clarity, and how to engage learners step-by-step.

### Goals for the Coming Weeks

In the remaining few weeks, we hope to:
- Finish building out all of the interactions and feedback loops.
- Peer review each other's work to catch confusion or ambiguity.
- Submit the lesson for feedback from Oppia’s community.

It’s been refreshing working on a project that doesn’t require code but still emphasizes user experience, clarity, and community impact.

# Learning Open Source from an NYU Grad Student

I've recently gotten into open source, and one of the coolest parts of this journey has been following insights from an NYU grad student who's deep in the trenches of development. There’s something refreshing about learning from someone who’s not just academically sharp, but also knee-deep in real-world code.

## Why It Stands Out

Graduate students often bring a unique blend of academic rigor and practical experimentation. The NYU student I follow shares a ton of lessons—from debugging obscure package issues to building sleek React interfaces—and they do it all while juggling coursework, projects, and research.

It’s not just about coding. They talk about community contributions, ethical licensing, how to write good commit messages, and even how to navigate burnout. It’s an honest look behind the scenes of building and contributing to open source in a way that feels approachable and human.

## What I’ve Learned So Far

- Version control best practices: Beyond just `git add .` and `git commit -m "stuff"`, I’ve learned about atomic commits, writing useful messages, and using branches effectively.
- Documentation matters: It’s not just code that counts. Good README files, inline comments, and issue templates make a huge difference.
- Community etiquette: Open source isn’t a free-for-all. There’s etiquette, and understanding how to be a good contributor (or maintainer) is key.

## Final Thoughts

It’s inspiring to see someone just a few years ahead of me doing such meaningful work. It makes open source feel less intimidating and more like something I can grow into.

So here’s to the NYU coders out there—thanks for sharing your journey and helping the rest of us along the way.
