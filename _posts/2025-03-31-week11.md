# Group Project Progress & Reflections

## Project Update: Building a Lesson on Oppia.org

This week, our team made solid progress on our group project for the class. We decided to create an interactive lesson for [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), an open-source platform designed to make education more accessible and engaging. One of the things we really like about Oppia is that it allows us to build out the lesson directly on their site—no coding required.

So far, we’ve brainstormed our learning objectives, outlined the structure of the lesson, and started creating the first few interactions. The platform's builder is surprisingly intuitive once you get used to the flow, and it's been great seeing our lesson take shape in real time. It’s also sparked some interesting team conversations about pedagogy, clarity, and how to engage learners step-by-step.

### Goals for the Coming Weeks

In the remaining few weeks, we hope to:
- Finish building out all of the interactions and feedback loops.
- Peer review each other's work to catch confusion or ambiguity.
- Submit the lesson for feedback from Oppia’s community.

It’s been refreshing working on a project that doesn’t require code but still emphasizes user experience, clarity, and community impact.
