## 🧑‍💻 Lecture 1: Project Group Work – Stand-Up Report

### ✅ Major Accomplishments
- Collaborated with my team to develop an interactive lesson on **Touring Manhattan** for our Oppia contribution.
- Created a series of custom images to support the multiple-choice questions — this was a fun and creative part of the process that helped make the lesson more engaging.
- Submitted **two GitHub tickets** to Oppia’s repository, addressing a feature request and a bug related to image uploads.

### 😕 Biggest Disappointments
- Encountered issues with image uploads on the Oppia platform, where images sometimes failed to display even after following the upload steps.
- Resolved the issue temporarily by refreshing the page repeatedly, but also filed a GitHub issue to help the Oppia dev team investigate a more permanent fix.

### 🛠️ Plan of Action (Next 3 Weeks)
- Implement interactive feedback for learner responses.
- Conduct user testing and collect peer feedback.
- Prepare the lesson for official plublication to the Oppia platform.
